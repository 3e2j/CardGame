--------------



Make sure the folder is extracted before usage.


Simply open 'Inscryption' to open the game.

If that doesn't work:

open command-prompt
type:
	py PATH

replace PATH with the directory of the folder. Python will auto execute '__main__.py'
For example:

	py C:/Users/username/Desktop/Inscryption



if python returns an error, either check that the PATH is correct or reinstall python from:
