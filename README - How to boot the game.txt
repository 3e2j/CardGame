Make sure the folder is extracted before usage.


Simply open 'Inscryption.bat' to open the game.

If that doesn't work:

    Try open __main__.py by double clicking, or using command prompt:
        Open command-prompt
        Type:
            py PATH

        Replace PATH with the directory of the folder. Python will auto execute '__main__.py'
        For example:
            py C:/Users/username/Desktop/Inscryption



if python returns an error, either check that the PATH is correct or reinstall python from:
https://www.python.org
